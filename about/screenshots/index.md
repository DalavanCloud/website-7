## Game Develop

[Game Develop][4] is game development software, using wxWidgets for all GUI
related tasks, allowing creation of any kind of 2D game without needing any
knowledge in a specific language. Everything is made using visual editors and
the software uses an event-based system, using conditions which have to be
filled so as to execute actions, to manage the game logic. These events are
compiled by Game Develop to machine code. Games can be compiled and distributed
for Windows and Ubuntu.
