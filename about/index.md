Introduction to wxWidgets (Flash Presentation, 340KB)

wxWidgets was started in 1992 by Julian Smart at the University of Edinburgh.
Initially started as a project for creating applications portable across Unix
and Windows, it has grown to support the Mac platform, WinCE, and many other
toolkits and platforms. The number of developers contributing to the project is
now in the dozens and the toolkit has a strong userbase that includes everyone
from open source developers to corporations such as AOL. So what is special
about wxWidgets compared with other cross-platform GUI toolkits?

wxWidgets gives you a single, easy-to-use API for writing GUI applications on
multiple platforms that still utilize the native platform's controls and
utilities. Link with the appropriate library for your platform
(Windows/Unix/Mac, others coming shortly) and compiler (almost any popular C++
compiler), and your application will adopt the look and feel appropriate to
that platform. On top of great GUI functionality, wxWidgets gives you: online
help, network programming, streams, clipboard and drag and drop,
multithreading, image loading and saving in a variety of popular formats,
database support, HTML viewing and printing, and much much more.
