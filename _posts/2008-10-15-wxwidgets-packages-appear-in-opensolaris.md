wxWidgets is [now available][1] as an [OpenSolaris][2] package. It had been
already included in OpenSolaris before, as a static library which was part of
the [pgAdmin][3] package, but now the shared libraries and files required for
development using wxWidgets (SUNWwxwidgets and SUNWwxwidgets-devel packages
respectively) are included as well.
