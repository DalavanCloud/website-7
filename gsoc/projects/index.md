Alternatively, you could decide to select a project depending on your
background, so that if you are a...

* Windows programmer -- then you could help us with
  [Direct2D-based wxGraphicsContext](#gc-d2d) or the
  [taskbar improvements](#win7-taskbar)
* Linux hacker -- then you could be interested in cross-platform
  [power management](#power-management) or
  [system sound](#sound) projects.
* Mac guru -- then, in addition to the two projects above, you could be
  interested in [wxiOS](#ios).
* Mobile enthusiast -- then either [wxAndroid](#android) or
  [wxiOS](#ios) could be exciting for you.
* Web/JavaScript developer -- then you should have a look at one of
  [wxWebView](#webview) projects.
* Somebody else -- tell us what could be interesting for you!

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Create minimally functional Android port.

<div class="pull-right">
	<img src="android_hello.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Hello World on Android" />
</div>

The goal of this project, or projects, as there could be more than one student
working on this, would be to start a wxAndroid port, i.e. an implementation of
wxWidgets API targeting the Android OS. It is infeasible to fully write such a
port in the GSoC time frame, but we believe that a motivated student could
provide a good foundation for such port and, ideally, something at least
minimally working.

The plan is to start by implementing the low-level classes needed by all
wxWidgets applications, such as `wxApp`, `wxWindow`, `wxTopLevelWindow`,
`wxEventLoop` and a few others. Once this is done it should be possible to use
`wxGLCanvas` to write Android applications using OpenGL for their graphics.

The next step could be to either implement more low-level classes such as the
GDI classes (`wxDC` and/or `wxGraphicsContext` and `wxBrush`, `wxPen`,
`wxBitmap` or the corresponding `wxGraphicsBrush`, `wxGraphicsPen`,
`wxGraphicsBitmap`) and use the wxUniversal port for the GUI controls, or start
implementing the GUI controls using native equivalents. In any case, the
student definitely would _not_ be expected to fully finish this part.

Providing access to native Android API from C++ for wxWidgets needs, which
would be required for the native controls use, could be a separate project in
its own right. It would consist in either improving one of the currently
existing tools, such as [CLE](http://code.google.com/p/cle-for-android/),
[cppjvm](https://github.com/danielearwicker/cppjvm),
[JACE](http://code.google.com/p/jace/) or
[JCC](http://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/jcc/index.html) or writing a new one
to allow easily creating and using Java objects, including overriding their
virtual methods, from C++ code.

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Improve wxiOS port

<div class="pull-right">
	<img src="ios_test.png" class="img-responsive" alt="wxWidgets under iOS" />
</div>

A previous GSoC project has created the basics of a wxWidgets port to iOS. The
task for this year would be to make this port really usable and complete the
missing parts.

In particular the [wxiOS branch][ios_branch], in which all the work had been
done up to now, would need to be merged into the mainline and all standard
controls would need to be implemented. Note that part of this project -- which
ideally should be done before submitting the proposal to work on it -- would
consist of building the existing wxiOS sources and ascertaining its current
state.

<a name="universal"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Fix bugs and implement missing features in wxUniversal

wxUniversal is a special wxWidgets port which implements high-level GUI
controls using wxWidgets itself instead of wrapping the native toolkit as all
the other ports do. It is useful for platforms which don't have their own
native UI (such as e.g. [DirectFB](http://directfb.org/)) or those in which the
native UI is difficult to wrap (see the discussion of [wxAndroid](#android)
project).

Unfortunately wxUniversal hasn't got much attention for many years and the
changes elsewhere in wxWidgets have introduced quite a few bugs in it. Also
many relatively recent controls are not implemented.

An incomplete list of known problems that would need to be corrected includes:

- Fix several appearance bugs seen in wxX11 port, such as too big padding for
  the buttons, wrongly drawn borders for many controls, occasional drawing
  artefacts such as failure to invert the selection in `wxTextCtrl`.
- `wxButton` and related classes should be refactored to inherit from
  `wxAnyButton` as in the other ports.
- `wxMenu` code needs to be updated to handle mouse capture loss/change events
  correctly.
- Drawing `wxSlider` shouldn't result in a crash.
- Implement support for popup windows and provide `wxTooltip` implementation
  using it.
- Update the existing theme or write a new one to provide a less dated than
  the currently used "classic Windows"-like appearance.
- Update the code to avoid using `wxDeprecatedGUIConstants` which result in
  hundreds of warnings when building it currently.

More problems might be discovered while working on this project.

[**Difficulty:**](../project-ratings) 7
[**Importance:**](../project-ratings) 6 (but more if wxUniv is used by wxAndroid)

#### Potential mentors

Vadim Zeitlin, Julian Smart

#### Experience needed

Some prior experience with wxWidgets would be helpful, as with any other
project, but no platform/toolkit-specific knowledge is needed for this task.

<a name="multitouch"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Support multi-touch gestures

The goal of this project is to generate wxWidgets events for the multi-touch
gestures recognized by the underlying system and, possibly, also the raw
touches which compose them. But it's adding support for the high level events,
such as "zoom", "pan" or "rotate" which is the most important part of this
project.

Modern desktop systems all support sending such events but do it in different
ways, so the first part of this project will be to find a subset of events and
information carried by them sufficiently rich to be useful, yet also supported
by more than one, and ideally by all three, major platforms.

[**Difficulty:**](../project-ratings) 7
[**Importance:**](../project-ratings) 7

#### Potential mentors

#### Experience needed

Ability to work with more than one platform is definitely required.

<a name="gc-d2d"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Implement wxGraphicsContext using Direct2D

![Drawing example](http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/ee413543.figure4%28en-us,MSDN.10%29.gif)

Currently, [wxGraphicsContext][] is implemented using GDI+ under Windows. GDI+
seems, unfortunately, to be abandoned by Microsoft and has a lot of problems
including generally very poor performance (as it is not hardware-accelerated at
all) and horrible text rendering, especially at small font sizes.

Since Windows 7 (and Vista with updates installed) another solution is available:
[Direct2D](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd370990.aspx).
This project would consist of implementing a new [wxGraphicsContext][] backend
using this new API, and its companion DirectWrite for the text output.

[**Difficulty:**](../project-ratings) 7
[**Importance:**](../project-ratings) 8

#### Potential mentors

Vadim Zeitlin, Julian Smart

#### Experience needed

Windows, COM (at a basic level), Direct2D itself would be great but can be
learned during the project.

<a name="win7-taskbar"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Add support for Windows 7 taskbar features

![Taskbar button anatomy](http://i.msdn.microsoft.com/dynimg/IC376143.png)

Windows Vista/7 has added support for several new features to the task bar
which are all accessible via [ITaskbarList3 interface](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd391692%28v=vs.85%29.aspx):

- Overlays: [example](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/02/11/10392502.aspx)
- Buttons: [example](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/02/18/10394684.aspx)
- Progress display
- Custom, possibly live, thumbnails: [example](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/02/25/10396638.aspx)
- More control over grouping: [example](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/08/17/10340743.aspx)
- Jump lists.

None of these features have equivalents under the other platforms,
unfortunately, but it would be nice to be able to make use of them at least
under Windows.

<a name="power-management"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Power management under non-Windows platforms

wxWidgets has support for
[power events](http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_power_event.html) but
it's currently only implemented on Windows and doesn't work for Vista and
later systems right now, e.g. it's impossible to prevent the system from
suspending in this way (which was used until Windows XP) any more. The goal of
this project would be to update power management support for Windows Vista/7
(which is simple to do, see
[this thread](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lib.wxwidgets.devel/120453))
and, most importantly, also implement them for Linux and/or OS X. This will
include devising an API which can be implemented on all platforms and actually
implementing it for Windows and at least one of Linux/OS X (and ideally both).

[**Difficulty:**](../project-ratings) 7 for either Linux or OS X, 8 if both
[**Importance:**](../project-ratings) 6

#### Potential mentors

Paul Cornett, Stefan Csomor

#### Experience needed

Linux part will require the use of DBUS and/or DeviceKit so experience using
them would be handy. OS X part obviously would be easier with some prior
experience with this platform (foundation level) API.

<a name="animation"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Cross-platform animation support

Animations are becoming and more important in the modern UIs but are not yet
supported by wxWidgets. The goal of this project would be to allow simple to
use cross-platform (including falling back to suppressing animations entirely
on the systems that don't support them) API for animating parts of the program
UI.

This project has been started during [GSoC 2011](/gsoc/2011) but never brought
to completion. The goal would be to revisit the work done so far and finish
the implementation of it for Windows and Cocoa.

Notice that in 2011 there was no simple way to support animation with GTK+,
but if this has changed since then, working on GTK-specific implementation
would be welcome too and could replace Windows or Cocoa part of this work.

[**Difficulty:**](../project-ratings) 8
[**Importance:**](../project-ratings) 6

#### Potential mentors

<a name="sound"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Cross platform support for playing system sounds

wxWidgets provides a `wxBell()` function which is as simple as it gets and the
wxSound class which allows sound files to be played but requires the file (or
sound data) to be present and produces the same result under all platforms
(meaning that it won't sound good on any of them). The goal of this project
would be to provide a way to play various "system sounds" in a simple and
portable way and respecting the user settings (in particular, not play anything
at all if the sound effects are turned off).

[**Difficulty:**](../project-ratings) 5-7
[**Importance:**](../project-ratings) 5

Difficulty is 5 is for a minimal usable implementation, 7 for something
sufficiently powerful to represent libcanberra API while still being
implementable on the other platforms.

#### Potential mentors

Julian Smart, Robin Dunn

#### Experience needed

Experience with the platforms being targeted would be welcome.

<a name="webview-features"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Make wxWebView more configurable

wxWebView currently works very well as a browser, but it lacks some features
to allow using it in other roles. For example, to use it for displaying HTML
messages in an email client, it must allow turning off support for JavaScript,
plugins, Java and even automatic image display as well as allowing
intercepting more events such as context menu building. We also need more
control over the use of cookies, file downloading etc.

The goal of this project would be to add the necessary API to allow for such
"controlled" use of wxWebView. Notice that ideally this would need to be done
for all three of the existing backends, ie Internet Explorer, WebKit and
Chromium, and at the very least for the first two.

[**Difficulty:**](../project-ratings) 5-7 (depending on the number of backends)
[**Importance:**](../project-ratings) 6

#### Potential mentors

Steven Lamerton, Vadim Zeitlin

#### Experience needed

Any experience with using `IID_IWebBrowser` and/or WebKit would be helpful.

<a name="webview-chromium"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Integrate and extend the Chromium backend

This project involves integrating and extending the existing wxWebViewChromium
backend for wxWebView on all platforms. Although the port current runs on
Windows and only a small amount of work should be needed for Linux support
further work is needed for Mac integration. Porting the code to the CEF3 API
would also be highly beneficial. This project has the potential to provide a
uniform backend for all three major platforms, and potentially opens the way
for better JavaScript integration.

[**Difficulty:**](../project-ratings) 6
[**Importance:**](../project-ratings) 7

#### Potential mentors

Knowledge of Chromium would be a plus.

<a name="webview-js"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> wxWebView JavaScript Integration

wxWebView currently provides a simple `RunScript()` function for running
JavaScript. However in many cases it would be preferable have access to a
return value, or even to call C++ from the JavaScript. This project would aim
to provide at least basic functionality for accessing JavaScript values. An API
would be required that ensures uniform behaviour across the different backends.
Before applying for this project please contact the wx-dev mailing list as
further research is required.

<a name="rtc-rtl"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Right-to-left languages support in wxRichTextCtrl

The goal is to support right-to-left languages such as Hebrew, including
support for composing individual diacritics from within [wxRichTextCtrl][].

This will also require improving support for the entry of Unicode characters
in wxWidgets globally, ie adding events for various IME actions and so would
be useful even for the programs not using wxRichTextCtrl.

[**Difficulty:**](../project-ratings) 8
[**Importance:**](../project-ratings) 7

#### Potential mentors

Julian Smart, Vadim Zeitlin

#### Experience needed

Good knowledge of Unicode and BiDi would be helpful. Knowledge of IME under
different platforms is also needed.


<!--

<a name="rtc-selection"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> wxRichTextCtrl text selection improvements

The aim would be to replace the current text selecting mechanism with a more
precise one and more correct from a visual point of view. Currently text
selection is emphasized by creating separate chunks from the selected text and
paint them separated from the rest of the text. The drawback is that often
there is a displacement of few pixels affecting the selected text compared with
the unselected text. Things are even worse if the row contains Tab characters.
As wxRichTextCtrl uses double buffering, a proposal is to have the selection
emphasized by painting the area(s) underneath the selection with the intended
color (using `wxRichTextCtrl::PaintBackground()`?), then text above it just
painted normally (maybe using a logical function with the DC). A very nice
example is in the Drawing sample in "Text screen" (F2) - the text that says
"There should be a text below".


<a name="rtc-justified"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Justified text alignment in wxRichTextCtrl

This could be done in a simpler fashion by only distributing extra space
(between words, and if needed adjust character spacing) and no hyphenation, or
more complicated by including hyphenation. The base should be a good algorithm.
Special cases: last row of a paragraph, last character in a row, images. There
is a "famous" TeX implementation but unfortunately I couldn't find any good
references for it (try [Tex (Wiki)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TeX#Hyphenation_and_justification),
[Tex (by D.Knuth)](http://tex.loria.fr/tex-source/tex-source.html)).
Another good description can be found here: Adobe InDesign, Text and
Typography. A JavaScript implementation can be found here:
[TeX line breaking algorithm in JavaScript](http://www.bramstein.com/projects/typeset/).

<a name="aui-native-art"></a>

## <i class="fa fa-lightbulb-o fa-fw"></i> Native art providers for wxAUI

The goal is to make wxAUI blend in better on a set of platforms, particularly
on Mac, GTK+ and Windows 7. The original wxAUI art is rather Windows XP-like
and it should be possible to take colours from the current theme and apply them
to wxAUI. Mostly this will be writing separate art provider classes, but
occasionally it may be necessary to dig deeper into the wxAUI code.

[**Difficulty:**](../project-ratings) 6
[**Importance:**](../project-ratings) 5

#### Potential mentors

Julian Smart, Bryan Petty

#### Experience needed

No platform-specific experience is needed as the art provider should behave in
the same way under all platforms.
