[Google Summer of Code][gsoc] (GSoC), is an amazing program organized by Google
which offers students stipends for working on open source projects.

wxWidgets is planning on applying for the 2015 program. If you are interested in
getting involved (and meet the [eligibility requirements][req]), you should
take the time to look over our list of [project ideas](/gsoc/projects/) to get
a feel for what kind of projects we might want to see proposals for. Project
proposals can be submitted starting March 10th, and the deadline is March 21st.

Please contact us by posting to [Developers mailing list][lists] if you would
like to get involved. Looking forward to hearing from you!

### Why Participate in GSoC with wxWidgets?

Generally speaking, GSoC is a great opportunity to start in the world of open
source development if you are curious about it or would like to improve your
programming skills. Here are some reasons to specifically choose wxWidgets as
your mentoring organization:

- **wxWidgets has a friendly community of developers** -
    We will welcome you warmly and do our best to help you to get up to speed
    quickly. You can always rely on getting answers to your questions on
    our mailing list.

- **wxWidgets is a popular, widely used library** -
    It is used by thousands of people and companies (including some that you
    might know, such as [Intel](http://wxwidgets.blogspot.com/2012/08/did-you-know-that-intel-vtune-used.html),
    Dropbox and [Google](https://plus.google.com/+wxwidgets/posts/1ms9xR7nEDD)).
    The code you will work on will get a lot of visibility and will gain
    you a lot of kudos from other developers, even those not using C++
    themselves as wxWidgets is also the basis of
    [wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/), [wxPerl](http://www.wxperl.it/),
    [wxRuby](http://wxruby.rubyforge.org/wiki/wiki.pl),
    [wxHaskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/WxHaskell),
    [wxLua](http://wxlua.sourceforge.net/) and many other languages GUI
    libraries.

- **We propose some great [projects](/gsoc/projects) for you to work on** -
    For example, porting the wxWidgets API to Android or iOS are definitely very
    exciting -- albeit quite challenging -- tasks. Other ones might be less
    innovative but you would still be creating something new and making it
    possible to do things that haven't been practical before in cross-platform
    programs.

- **We have participated in seven previous GSoCs** -
    So we have quite a lot of experience mentoring students. In fact, some of
    the potential mentors are students themselves and will be able to help you
    effectively.

- **wxWidgets is a representative example of a big, mature C++ project** -
    Working on its code base will undoubtedly help you to work on other
    real-life projects in the industry in the future.

### What Should I Do Next?

Once you have found a project that interests you, or if you have your own
suggestion, you should read through the [student guidelines](student-guidelines)
page. Especially important are contacting the wx-dev mailing list and
[submitting some simple patches](making-patches) to the project. When writing
your application please keep the [application template](application-template)
and deadline in mind, good luck!
